# Privacy Policy - Scroll-Lock for AI Chat

## No Data Collection

This browser extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or information. The extension operates entirely locally within your browser and does not communicate with any external servers or services.

## What the Extension Does

- **Local Operation Only**: The extension runs JavaScript locally in your browser to prevent auto-scrolling on supported AI chat websites
- **No Network Requests**: No data is sent over the internet
- **No Data Storage**: No user data, browsing history, or personal information is stored locally or remotely
- **No Analytics**: No usage analytics or tracking of any kind

## Permissions Explained

The extension requires certain permissions to function:

- **Content Script Injection**: Required to run the scroll-blocking JavaScript on supported websites (ChatGPT, Claude, Google Gemini)
- **Host Permissions**: Needed to access the specific domains where the extension operates

These permissions are used solely to inject the scroll-blocking functionality and do not enable data collection.

## Open Source

This extension is completely open source. You can review the entire codebase to verify that no data collection occurs. The source code is available for inspection and modification.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the extension's functionality, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
