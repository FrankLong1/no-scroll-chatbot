# Potential Issues with Aggressive Scroll Blocking

This extension blocks **ALL** programmatic scrolling on AI chat platforms. While this effectively stops auto-scroll behavior, it may interfere with legitimate functionality.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Potential Breakages

### User Interface Elements
- **Dropdown menus** that use `scrollIntoView()` to show selected items
- **Autocomplete suggestions** that scroll the selected option into view
- **Context menus** that reposition themselves when near screen edges
- **Tooltips** that trigger scrolling to remain visible
- **Modal dialogs** that auto-center themselves in the viewport

### Form Functionality  
- **Form validation** that scrolls to the first error field
- **Multi-step forms** that scroll to the next section
- **File upload dialogs** that scroll to show upload progress
- **Search suggestions** that scroll to highlight matches
- **Input field focus** that brings fields into view on mobile

### Accessibility Features
- **"Skip to main content"** links for screen readers
- **Keyboard navigation** that relies on `scrollIntoView()` for focus indication
- **Tab order management** that scrolls focused elements into view
- **Screen reader anchors** that programmatically navigate content
- **High contrast mode** adjustments that reposition elements

### AI Platform Specific Features
- **Code block copying** that might scroll to show copied content
- **Image previews** that center themselves when opened
- **Conversation threading** that jumps between related messages
- **Search result highlighting** that scrolls to matches
- **Reference links** that navigate to specific parts of conversations

### Mobile & Touch Interactions
- **Virtual keyboard** adjustments that scroll input fields into view
- **Orientation changes** that reposition content
- **Zoom functionality** that maintains focus position
- **Touch gestures** that trigger programmatic scrolling
- **Responsive breakpoint** changes that adjust scroll position

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Embedded widgets** (calendar pickers, color selectors)
- **Authentication flows** that redirect and scroll to forms
- **Social media embeds** that auto-size and position
- **Payment forms** that validate and scroll to errors
- **Chat widgets** or help systems on the platforms

### Browser & Extension Interactions
- **Browser autofill** that scrolls to show suggestions
- **Password managers** that scroll to login forms
- **Translation services** that adjust page layout
- **Ad blockers** that modify page structure
- **Developer tools** that scroll to inspected elements

## ü§î Philosophical Concerns

### User Agency vs Convenience
- Removes automatic convenience features that some users expect
- Forces manual scrolling which may be less efficient in some workflows
- May conflict with user muscle memory from other applications

### Accessibility Trade-offs
- Improves experience for users who dislike auto-scroll
- May degrade experience for users who rely on programmatic navigation
- Could interfere with assistive technologies

### Maintenance Burden
- AI platforms may introduce new scroll methods we don't block
- Updates to platforms could reveal new breaking scenarios
- No way to "soft disable" for specific features without code changes

## ‚úÖ Why We Accept These Risks

1. **Primary use case**: The auto-scroll during AI responses is the main annoyance
2. **Manual fallback**: Users can always scroll manually as needed
3. **Targeted deployment**: Only runs on AI chat platforms, not general web browsing
4. **Easy removal**: Extension can be quickly disabled if problems arise
5. **User preference**: The user specifically wants aggressive blocking

## üîß Potential Mitigations (Not Implemented)

- **Timing-based filtering**: Only block scrolling during AI response generation
- **Distance-based filtering**: Only block large scroll movements
- **User interaction detection**: Allow scrolling shortly after user input
- **Element-specific allowlists**: Permit scrolling for specific UI components
- **Soft disable hotkey**: Temporarily disable blocking with keyboard shortcut

**Current Status**: Aggressive blocking enabled by design. User prefers manual control over programmatic convenience.
